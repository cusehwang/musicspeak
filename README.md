### Abstract
Language transfer creates a challenge for Chinese (L1) speakers in acquiring English (L2) rhythm. This appears to be a widely
encountered difficulty among foreign learners of English, and is a major obstacle in acquiring a near-native oral proficiency. This
paper presents a system named MusicSpeak, which strives to capitalize on musical rhythm for prosodic training in second language
acquisition. This is one of the first efforts that develop an automatic procedure which can be applied to arbitrary English sentences,
to cast rhythmic patterns in speech into rhythmic patterns in music. Learners can practice by speaking in synchrony with the musical
rhythm. Evaluation results suggest that after practice, the learnersâ€™ speech generally achieves higher durational variability and better
approximates stress-timed rhythm.
